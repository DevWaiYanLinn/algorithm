# Welcome Pattern

This Python program prints a "welcome" pattern based on user input.

## Usage

1. Run the `vinc()` function.
2. Enter the size of N and M (where M must be 3 times N and N must be 5 or greater than 5).
3. The program will print the "welcome" pattern based on the provided input.

## Example

Try giving an input of "7 21", it would give an output like this below.
``` python
---------.|.---------        
------.|..|..|.------        
---.|..|..|..|..|.---        
-------WELCOME-------        
---.|..|..|..|..|.---        
------.|..|..|.------        
---------.|.---------   
```

## Code Explanation

The code works by first validating the input to ensure that N and M meet the required conditions. Then, it constructs the welcome pattern using loops and string formatting.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python file.
3. Run the Python file using a Python interpreter.
4. Follow the on-screen instructions to input the size of N and M.

```python
python welcome_pattern.py
```
